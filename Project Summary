In this case study I used a fictional cruising company's data to evaluate Net Promoter Score by Loyalty Tier, as well as how much money is being spent on incidents per guest and per Voyage. This was to determine where compensation might need to be adjusted or need further evaluation. I joined two different tables (Incidents and Guest experience) and used MySQL to clean, R programming to analyze and some Data Visualization in Tableau.
